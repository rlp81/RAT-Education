# RAT-Education

**RAT-Education** is a simple Remote Administration Tool (RAT) written in C++ for educational purposes.  
It demonstrates the core concepts behind remote access trojans (RATs) â€“ allowing a server to control and communicate with remote clients over a TCP connection.

> This project is intended **solely for educational use**.  
> Do not use it for unauthorized access or control of any devices.  
> Always have explicit permission before running or connecting to any clients.

## Features

- **TCP Server**
  - Available for both **Windows** and **Linux**
  - Listens for connections on a configurable port (`5555` by default)
  - Handles multiple clients using threads
  - Interactive command prompt for sending commands to clients
  - "Broadcast" mode for sending commands to all clients
  - Periodic keep-alive messages to monitor client status

- **Client Handler**
  - Waits for a `?connect` handshake from new clients
  - Supports sending and receiving commands and responses
  - Detects client disconnects and cleans up resources

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux OS
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio for Windows, g++/clang for Linux)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and networking

---

### Build Instructions

#### Windows Server

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rlp81/RAT-Education.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE**
3. **Ensure you link with `Ws2_32.lib`** (required for Winsock)
4. **Build the project**

#### Linux Server

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rlp81/RAT-Education.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the server directory**
   ```sh
   cd RAT-Education/server
   ```
3. **Compile the Linux server**
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++11 linux.cpp -o linux_server -lpthread
   ```
   - If you encounter errors related to missing headers or libraries, ensure you have build-essential installed:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```
4. **Run the Linux server**
   ```sh
   ./linux_server
   ```

## Usage

- When the server is running, connected clients will be listed in the console.
- You can select an individual client by number, or type `0` to broadcast a command to all clients.
- The server sends periodic keep-alive messages to ensure clients remain connected.

---

## Connecting Clients

- Clients should connect to the server's IP and port.
- Upon connecting, the client must send a `?connect` message to begin communication.

*Note: This repository does not include a client implementation. You may create your own client for learning purposes.*

---

## Code Overview

- **server/windows.cpp**  
  Implements the Windows TCP server and client management.
- **server/linux.cpp**  
  Implements the Linux TCP server and client management.
- Both use C++ standard library features (`thread`, `map`, `vector`, etc.)  
  Handle socket operations and command processing.
